# RheaFMEditorUi

This web application provides a user-friendly interface for managing feature models. With this tool, you can upload your own feature model or select one of the pre-existing examples available. You can then perform various operations on the feature model, such as viewing the tree representation, editing the feature model, modifying node attributes and constraints, viewing the constraint tree, and analyzing semantic metrics. Additionally, the tool offers an interoperability matrix that enables you to restructure the tree and download it in different languages and formats.

## Usage

Upon accessing the Angular 15 Feature Model Tool in your browser, you will be presented with the following options:

- **Upload Feature Model**: Use this option to upload your own feature model file in a supported format (e.g., XML, JSON).
- **Select Example**: Choose from a list of pre-existing feature model examples included with the application.

Once a feature model is loaded, you can perform the following actions:

- **View Tree**: Visualize the feature model as a tree structure.
- **Edit Feature Model**: Modify the structure of the feature model by adding, deleting, or reordering nodes.
- **Edit Node Attributes**: Customize the attributes of individual nodes in the feature model.
- **Edit Constraints**: Define constraints and relationships between nodes.
- **View Constraint Tree**: Explore the constraint tree to understand dependencies and interrelationships.
- **View Semantic Metrics**: Analyze semantic metrics to evaluate the quality and coherence of the feature model.
- **Interoperability Matrix**: Use the matrix to restructure the feature model for different languages and formats.
- **Download Feature Model**: Download the modified feature model in a language and format of your choice.
